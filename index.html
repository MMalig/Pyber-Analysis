	<title>Pyber Ride Sharing Data Analysis</title>
<h1> Pyber Plot Analysis </h1>
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing a set of ride sharing data from a fictioal company known as <i>Pyber</i>. Our findings from the analysis are shown below:

<h3>Total Rides and Average Fares by City Type</h3>

<em> Most rides occur in urban cities while rural cities hold the highest average fare </em>

<h3> % of Total Drivers by City Type </h3>

<em> Since most rides occur in urban cities, it makes sense that urban cities will also hold the highest concentration of available drivers </em>

<h3>% of Total Fares by City Type</h3>

<em> Even though rural cities hold the highest average fare, urban cities still generage the most revenue due to the sheer volume of rides given </em>
